# Tic-Tac-Toe
## About the Project
In this project we built a tic-tac-toe game. The main goal is to practice object oriented programming(OOP).

This game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns claiming cells on the grid using their symbol ‚Äòx‚Äô for the first player and an ‚Äòo‚Äô for the second one in an attempt to be the first player to mark three cells together, they can be in the same row, column or in diagonal, the first who archives it, wins!.

Milestones for this project:
First Milestone: Project Setup.
Second Milestone: User interface.
Third Milestone: Game logic.
Fourth Milestone: Final touches and instructions for the players.

### Game Instructions
Tic-Tac-Toe is a very popular game, which consists in making a sequence of three symbols in either a row, column or diagonal in a 3x3 board.

To play the game follow the getting started steps mentioned before. After you have done that, run the "main" file and follow these steps:

First you need to introduce player one name.

Then you need to introduce player two name.

The game will display the board.

Player one choose a position in the board from 1 to 9 which is not occupied.

Player two choose a position in the board from 1 to 9 which is not occupied.

You will have turns, in sequence until there is a winner or the board is full which would result in a draw.

If you want to play again you can type bin/main.rb again and the game will reset.
